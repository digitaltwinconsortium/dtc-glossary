## Infrastructure Digital Twin

> An infrastructure digital twin is a [digital twin](glossary.md#digital-twin) that represents infrastructure assets and systems, their environment, and productive and non-productive processes relevant to their operation.

Examples of assets include roads, rail, facilities, buildings, bridges, offshore platforms, etc.

Examples of systems include transportation and utility networks, heating systems, etc.

Examples of the environment include geographic features and portions of the built environment that are not modeled as assets.

Examples of processes include the flows of traffic, resources, or people; weather, floods, fires, earthquakes, and other resilience-related events; corrosion and other forms of degradation; solar, wind, hydroelectric, or other sources of energy generation; etc.

***Alternate terms***

- [Built Environment Digital Twin](#built-environment-digital-twin) is a viable alternative term that is semantically more inclusive of "Buildings" which are sometimes considered to be distinct from "Infrastructure".
